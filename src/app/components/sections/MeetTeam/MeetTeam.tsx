        "My developer journey first started when a friendly customer approached while I was bartending in my early 20's suggesting that I give coding a try. From the minute I wrote my first line of code, I completely fell in love and have pursued web development to it's fullest. I've worked in SaaS & Marketo agencies where I've had the pleasure of working with clients such as Meta, Amazon, Twilio, and S&P Global, building cutting edge Marketo email & landing page templates.",
        "Today I bring all my experience to Innovative Foxes for you. While it may sound like a grand establishment, it's entirely run by me working alongside talented Marketo developers and designers I've come to know along the way. I prioritize quality over quantity, which is why at Innovative Foxes we ensure each team member collaborates with only one client at a time, ensuring you receive dedicated attention and top-tier Marketo solutions at a comfortable rate delivered on time.",
        "Moreover, I deeply value building long-term relationships with my clients, fostering a partnership that grows and evolves over time. I look forward to collaborating with you and I truly believe we can do some great things together!",
