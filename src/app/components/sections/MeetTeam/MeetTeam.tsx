              My developer journey first started when a friendly customer
              approached while I was bartending in my early 20's suggesting that
              I give coding a try. From the minute I wrote my first line of
              code, I completely fell in love and have pursued web development
              to it's fullest. I've worked in SaaS & Marketo agencies where I've
              had the pleasure of working with clients such as Meta, Amazon,
              Twilio, and S&P Global, building cutting edge Marketo email &
              landing page templates.

            <Text fontSize="md" lineHeight="tall" color="gray.700">
              Today I bring all my experience to Innovative Foxes for you. While
              it may sound like a grand establishment, it's entirely run by me
              working alongside talented Marketo developers and designers I've
              come to know along the way. I prioritize quality over quantity,
              which is why at Innovative Foxes we ensure each team member
              collaborates with only one client at a time, ensuring you receive
              dedicated attention and top-tier Marketo solutions at a
              comfortable rate delivered on time.
            </Text>

            <Text fontSize="md" lineHeight="tall" color="gray.700">
              Moreover, I deeply value building long-term relationships with my
              clients, fostering a partnership that grows and evolves over time.
              I look forward to collaborating with you and I truly believe we
              can do some great things together!
